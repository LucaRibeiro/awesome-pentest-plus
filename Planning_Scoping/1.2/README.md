## Standards and methodologies

### MITRE ATT&CK

MITRE ATT&CK® is a not-for-profit organization that provides access to public community resource for conducting vulnerability research and analysis such as:

- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
- Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)
- Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)

The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community. With the creation of ATT&CK, MITRE is fulfilling its mission to solve problems for a safer world — by bringing communities together to develop more effective cybersecurity. ATT&CK is open and available to any person or organization for use at no charge.

### Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

The Open Web Application Security Project® (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.

- Education & Training

### National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST is one of the nation's oldest physical science laboratories.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is voluntary guidance, based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices for organizations to better manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. In addition to helping organizations manage and reduce risks, it was designed to foster risk and cybersecurity management communications amongst both internal and external organizational stakeholders.

### Open-source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) is a comprehensive document released by Pete Herzog and distributed by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM).
According to OSSTMM, every penetration testing should include security testing of information, processes, internet technology (port scanning, firewalls, and so on), Communications, Wireless and Physical environment.

### Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) is a set of technical sections. It helps the penetration tester to deliver an effective pentesting report by walking through the following seven sections:

- Pre-engagement interactions
- Intelligence gathering
- Threat modeling
- Vulnerability analysis
- Exploitation
- Post-exploitation
- Reporting

### Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is a methodology where the penetration tester imitates the hacking steps with some additional phases. It goes through the following phases:

- Information gathering
- Network mapping
- Vulnerability identification
- Penetration
- Gaining access and privilege escalation
- Enumerating further
- Compromising remote users/sites
- Maintaining access
- Covering the tracks

## Rules of engagement (RoE)

The Rules of Engagement document defines how penetration testing will be conducted. Before writing the Rules of Engagement document, the pentester first needs to determine the type of penetration testing that needs to be performed. Some of the key components of the Rules of Engagement document are:

- **Scope/Test boundaries**
  - What will be tested?
  - Is social engineering allowed to be used?
  - How invasive can the pentest be?
- **Applicable industry standards**
  - What is the methodology performed?
  - It's compliance testing? Or full Red Team testing?
- **Timeline**
  - How long will the test be conducted?
  - What task will be performed and how long will each be planned for?
- **Locations**
  - Where will the testers be located? (On-site or remote)
  - Does organization have numerous locations?
  - Does it cross international borders?
- **Time restrictions**
  - Are there certain times tha aren't authorized?
  - What about days of te week?
  - What about holidays?
- **Transparency**
  - Who will know about the pentest?
  - Will the organization provide resources to te testers?

  1. **Internal testing** is conducted behind perimeter defenses using three methods of access:
     - **Limited access:** only connection with target.
     - **User Level access:** trusted insider with basic permission.
     - **Privileged level access:** privileged credentials or access and the main objective is escalate the access.
  2. **External testing** provides more limited-access vector and occurs on the outside of the network security perimeter,providing in the result a malicious attacker's point of view.

  1.  **First-party** targets are hosted within the organization and can be easier to coordination of testing activities, as customer owns the equipment and testing is simply subject to the company1s policies.
  2.  If the targets are hosted in **third-party** environment, such as cloud service provider(CSP), it also subject to the third party's acceptable use policies.
