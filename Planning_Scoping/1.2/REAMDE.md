# 1.2 Explain the importance of scoping and organizational/customer requirements.

## Standards and methodologies

### MITRE ATT&CK

### Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

### National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

### Open-source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

### Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

### Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

## Rules of engagement

The Rules of Engagement document defines how penetration testing will be conducted. Before writing the Rules of Engagement document, the pentester first needs to determine the type of penetration testing that needs to be performed. Some of the key components of the Rules of Engagement document are:

- **Timeline**: define the duration of penetration testing. It should also include the time when penetration testing will be conducted.
- **Targets**: Information about thhe targets such as:
  - Locations
  - Systems
  - Applications
  - Third-party service providers (if any), such as Internet service providers (ISPs),Software as a Service (SaaS) providers
- **Data Handling**: how the confidential data must be handled during the penetration testing. It should also mention what needs to be done with the penetration testing data and its results after the engagement is contractually over.
- **Target Behaviors**: behavior output from the targets during penetration testing. For example, what should the pentester be expecting the firewall to do when you perform an attack on it.
- **Communication Methods**: Depending upon the length of the engagement, the communication timeline can be defined. For example, if it is a one-month long test, then weekly communication can work. However, if the test is going to last only one week, the pentester can simply provide the results after he or she is done with the test.
- **Single Point of Contact (SPOC)**: the person who initially engaged the pentester in this activity and is also the contact point for any issue that may arise during the penetration testing. From the penetration testing, one of the pentester is also designated as a SPOC who connects with the client SPOC in case any issue arises.
- **Escalation Channel**: An escalation could be related to finding something, such as a critical vulnerability, that needs immediate attention. The pentester should know whom to approach. Ideally, a decision-maker should be on the escalation channel.
- **Legal Concerns**: Any legal concern related to penetration testing must be clearly defined. It is important because a legal concern can impact not only the organization but also the pentester who is performing the testing.
- **Disclaimers**: Penetration testing is performed on a specific network, servers, and application configuration. If there is a change in the smallest configuration, it could nullify the results of the penetration testing.

## Environmental considerations

### Network

### Application

### Cloud

## Target list/in-scope assets

### Wireless networks

### Internet Protocol (IP) ranges

### Domains

### Application programming interfaces (APIs)

### Physical locations

### Domain name system (DNS)

### External vs. internal targets

Threat actors are any entity behind a threat, which is a potential danger to an asset. A threat actor can be largely categorized into three categories:

- Internal Threat (e.g., a rogue employee)
- External Threat (e.g., a criminal gang)

Threat actors look for vulnerabilities, which are weaknesses that can be exploited. When a vulnerability is present in the network, server, or application, there is a risk that the threat actor may exploit it.

### First-party vs. third-party hosted

First-party targets are hosted within the organization and can be an easy target. One of the common attacks could be zero-day vulnerability exploitation. A zero-day attack exploits an unknown vulnerability. Third-party targets can be difficult to penetrate, specifically if they are with a large organization, which can have multiple layers of security controls. Smaller organizations’ targets can be easy to penetrate.

Third-party targets are either hosted at a vendor site or by a partner organization. Third-party targets can be difficult to penetrate, specifically if they are with a large organization, which can have multiple layers of security controls. Smaller organizations’ targets can be easy to penetrate.

### Question the client/review contracts

### Time management

### Strategy

### Unknown-environment vs. known-environment testing
