## 1.1 Regulatory compliance considerations

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

PCI-DSS assessment is applicable to organizations that deal with credit, debit, and cash card transactions. It is intended to protect the cardholders so that their personal information cannot be misused. It defines strict parameters for the organizations so that the cardholdersâ€™ information can be protected.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It's the core of Europe's digital privacy legislation.

### Service-level agreement (SLA)

Managed services are often marked by detailed service level agreements (SLAs), which typically include provisions for performance, security, efficiency, accountability, response times, and relevant upgrades.

### Confidentiality

### Statement of work (SOW)

A statement of work (SOW) is a document routinely employed in the field of project management. It is the narrative description of a project's work requirement.

The SOW details the following information:

- Purpose of the work being assigned to the pentester
- The scope of the assignment
- Tasks to be performed as part of the scope
- Milestones for various phases of the assignment
- The expected deliverables at the end of the assignment
- The timeline or schedule for the assignment
- Total amount to be paid to the pentester

### Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)

A non-disclosure agreement is signed between both parties, where each of the parties is defined clearly. It mandates that the confidential information must not be shared with a third-party.

- Definition of Confidential Information
- Purpose of the NDA
- No Disclosure clause mentioning that the recipient should protect the information as they protect their own
- Duration of the agreement
- Severability
- Exclusions from the confidential information

The intent of an NDA is simple - the owner of the information needs a written surety from the recipient that the information will not be shared with an unauthorized party.

### Master service agreement

An MSA is used typically when two parties intend to work for a long time or over multiple projects. In such a scenario, an MSA is created that broadly lists the work to be done over a period of time. The total cost of the work is defined. It is created before a Statement of Work (SOW) is created.
