- ### **[Exploit database (DB)](https://www.exploit-db.com/)**

  The Exploit Database is a non-profit project that is provided as a public service by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/)). It's a CVE compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away.

  Global Security Resource
  In these times where a new major data breach occurs on a daily basis, it is important for the personal Internet user, corporations, and governments to stay aware of vulnerabilities that may affect their systems. Packet Storm provides around-the-clock information and tools in order to help mitigate both personal data and fiscal loss on a global scale. As new information surfaces, Packet Storm releases everything immediately through it's RSS feeds, Twitter, and Facebook. The site is referenced in over a hundred books and has a history of being spotlighted in the news.

  The ancient Chinese millitary master Sun Tzu said: "I say: Know your enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle." This maxim applies to the battlefield that is today's modern network, just as it has to all of the battlefields throughout humanity's long and strife ridden history.

  In the modern world, security is everyone's job. If you are a vice president of engineering or an administrator in the trenches, responsibility lies with both parties for the safety of the organization. If you are deploying third party software in a PCI controlled environment, searching exploits and advisories may alert you to a bad track record for vulnerabilities that may change your decision. If you are outsourcing to a company that has had multiple data breaches in the past 5 years, searching the historical news feeds will shed light on their issues. If you are designing a web application and need to know common attack vectors and mitigation techniques, the whitepapers section provides guidance. If you are performing a penetration test for a client, the tools and exploits sections offer the latest available.

  Our Demographics
  Packet Storm has been a cornerstone on the Internet since 1998 and is visited monthly by over 190 countries. The site is meant to provide a unique service to everyone on the Internet - shedding full light on real security issues that may affect them. It is home to system administrators who need to keep their network up to date, security researchers who discover and report new findings, governments and corporations that need to understand current events, security vendors that want to develop new signatures for their software, and many others. Get involved and help secure the world.

## **Attacks**

- ### **ARP poisoning**
  ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.
- ### **Exploit chaining**
- ### **Password attacks**
  1. **Password spraying:** Type of brute force attack which the same password or a few commonly passwords is used in large number of account avoiding detection or account lockouts.
  2. **Hash cracking:**
  3. **Brute force:**
  4. **Dictionary:**
- ### **On-path (previously known as man-in-the-middle)**
- ### **Kerberoasting**
- ### **DNS cache poisoning**
- ### **Virtual local area network (VLAN) hopping**
- ### **Network access control (NAC) bypass**
- ### **Media access control (MAC) spoofing**
- ### **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)/NetBIOS-Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning**
- ### **New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) relay attacks**

## **Tools**

- ### **Metasploit**
- ### **Netcat**
- ### **Nmap**
