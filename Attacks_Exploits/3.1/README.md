- ### **[Exploit database (DB)](https://www.exploit-db.com/)**

[Site]](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

The Exploit Database is maintained by Offensive Security, an information security training company that provides various Information Security Certifications as well as high end penetration testing services. The Exploit Database is a non-profit project that is provided as a public service by Offensive Security.

The Exploit Database is a CVE compliant archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away.

The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting, and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases, this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk recorded at DEFCON 13. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user. Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB over to Offensive Security in November 2010, and it is now maintained as an extension of the Exploit Database. Today, the GHDB includes searches for other online search engines such as Bing, and other online repositories like GitHub, producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Packet storm
[Site](https://packetstormsecurity.com/)

In these times where a new major data breach occurs on a daily basis, it is important for the personal Internet user, corporations, and governments to stay aware of vulnerabilities that may affect their systems. Packet Storm provides around-the-clock information and tools in order to help mitigate both personal data and fiscal loss on a global scale. As new information surfaces, Packet Storm releases everything immediately through it's RSS feeds, Twitter, and Facebook. The site is referenced in over a hundred books and has a history of being spotlighted in the news.

The ancient Chinese millitary master Sun Tzu said: "I say: Know your enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles, you will never be defeated. When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal. If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are sure to be defeated in every battle." This maxim applies to the battlefield that is today's modern network, just as it has to all of the battlefields throughout humanity's long and strife ridden history.

In the modern world, security is everyone's job. If you are a vice president of engineering or an administrator in the trenches, responsibility lies with both parties for the safety of the organization. If you are deploying third party software in a PCI controlled environment, searching exploits and advisories may alert you to a bad track record for vulnerabilities that may change your decision. If you are outsourcing to a company that has had multiple data breaches in the past 5 years, searching the historical news feeds will shed light on their issues. If you are designing a web application and need to know common attack vectors and mitigation techniques, the whitepapers section provides guidance. If you are performing a penetration test for a client, the tools and exploits sections offer the latest available.

Packet Storm has been a cornerstone on the Internet since 1998 and is visited monthly by over 190 countries. The site is meant to provide a unique service to everyone on the Internet - shedding full light on real security issues that may affect them. It is home to system administrators who need to keep their network up to date, security researchers who discover and report new findings, governments and corporations that need to understand current events, security vendors that want to develop new signatures for their software, and many others. Get involved and help secure the world.

## **Attacks**

- ### **ARP poisoning**
  ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.
- ### **Exploit chaining**
- ### **Password attacks**
  1. **Password spraying:** Type of brute force attack which the same password or a few commonly passwords is used in large number of account avoiding detection or account lockouts.
  2. **Hash cracking:**
  3. **Brute force:**
  4. **Dictionary:**
- ### **On-path (previously known as man-in-the-middle)**
- ### **Kerberoasting**
- ### **DNS cache poisoning**
- ### **Virtual local area network (VLAN) hopping**
- ### **Network access control (NAC) bypass**
- ### **Media access control (MAC) spoofing**
- ### **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)/NetBIOS-Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning**
- ### **New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) relay attacks**

## **Tools**

- ### **Metasploit**
- ### **Netcat**
- ### **Nmap**
=======
Also known as ARP Spoofing, this attack carried out over a Local Area Network (LAN) that involves sending malicious ARP packets to a default gateway on 
a LAN informing it that his or her MAC address should be associated with his or her target's IP address and vice-versa. ARP Protocol translates IP addresses 
into MAC addresses. The default gateway has received this message and broadcasts its changes to all other devices on the network, all of the target's traffic 
to any other device on the network travels through the attacker's computer, allowing the attacker to inspect or modify it before forwarding it to its real 
destination. Because the ARP protocol was designed purely for efficiency and not for security, ARP Poisoning attacks are extremely easy to carry out as long 
as the attacker has control of a machine within the target LAN or is directly connected to it.

### Exploit chaining


### Password attacks

- **Password spraying:** Variant of brute force attack that attempts to access a large number of accounts (usernames) with a few commonly used passwords.
- **Hash cracking:** Break a hash to get the password in clear text
- **Brute force:** Test a lot of password or passphrases guessing the correct with purpose to access account. 
- **Dictionary:** Method of breaking into a password-protected by entering every word in a dictionary as a password.

### Evil twin

Cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating 
with each other. 

:::image type="content" source="../assets/man-in-middle.png" alt-text="man-in-the-middle":::

### Kerberoasting

Kerberoasting abuses traits of the Kerberos protocol to harvest password hashes for Active Directory user accounts with servicePrincipalName (SPN) values 
(i.e. service accounts). A user is allowed to request a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket for any SPN, and parts of the TGS may be encrypted with the with 
RC4 using the password hash of the service account assigned the requested SPN as the key.

An adversary who is able to extract the TGS tickets from memory, or captures them by sniffing network traffic, can extract the service account’s password hash 
and attempt an offline brute force attack to obtain the plaintext password.
