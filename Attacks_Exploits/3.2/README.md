## Attack methods

### Eavesdropping

An eavesdropping attack, also known as a sniffing or snooping attack, takes advantage of unsecured network communications to access data and theft information as it is being sent or received by its user.

### Data modification

A simple modification of the data transmitted over the network.

### Data corruption

Corruption of the data transmitted over the network, like removing bytes, changing headers, etc.

### Relay attacks

Type of hacking technique related to man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. In a classic relay attack, the attacker initiates communication with both parties who then merely relays messages between the two parties without manipulating them or even necessarily reading them.

### Spoofing

### Deauthentication

### Jamming

### Capture handshakes

### On-path

On-path, also know as [man-in-the-middle](../3.1/README.me#On-path%20%28previously%20known%20as%20man-in-the-middle%29) attack, is a type of eavesdropping. Can be performed in a wireless network with ARP Spoofing and others techniques.
