# Information Gathering and Vulnerability Scanning

## [2.1 Given a scenario, perform passive reconnaissance.](./2.1)

- DNS lookups
- Identify technical contacts
- Administrator contacts
- Cloud vs. self-hosted
- Social media scraping
  - Key contacts/job responsibilities

- Cryptographic flaws
  - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates
  - Revocation
- Company reputation/security posture
- Data
  - Password dumps
  - File metadata
