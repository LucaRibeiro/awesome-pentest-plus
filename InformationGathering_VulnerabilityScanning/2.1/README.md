### Sources

1. ### **Common weakness enumeration (CWE)**
   CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) is a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts.
2. ### **Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE)**
   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.
