## Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

OSINT is a multi-factor (qualitative, quantitative) methodology for collecting, analyzing and making decisions about data accessible in **publicly available sources** to be used in an intelligence context.

- ### Tools
  - **[Shodan](../../Tools_CodeAnalysis/5.3#shodan)**
  - **[Recon-ng](../../Tools_CodeAnalysis/5.3#recon-ng)**
- ### Sources
  - **Common weakness enumeration (CWE)**: Community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types and mitigations for implementing good secure coding practices and software design. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. The CWE security weaknesses are broken uo into three categories:
    - **Research concepts**: Intended for academic research
    - **Development concepts**: Weaknesses encountered during software development.
    - **Architectural concepts**: Weaknesses encountered during software engineering.
  - **Common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE)**: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures.
